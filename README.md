# AGK-MapGenerator
My personal AGK top-down 2D level editor. Made with AGK v1.

This project is in development but due to pure lack of spare time it's progressing rather slowly.

## Planned features
* Saving and loading map/level data to and from a file respectively.
* Layer-based tile placement
 * One layer for "ground" tiles, one for static/dynamic objects.
* Dedicated asset drawer/holder for smooth asset browsing and picking.
* Editor view panning and zooming.
* Support for different tile and level/map sizes.
* etc.
